_I’ve been sitting on this draft for a few weeks, it’s mostly notes for a series of talks I’m giving over the next few months. Nonetheless, I felt like I needed to post it. Partially for reference. Alas, here it is._

For the past few years, I’ve been thinking about the interconnected nature of experiences. While there’s already a rough discipline of ‘experience design’ it’s largely an amalgamation of the work we’re doing everyday in tech to build the tools that people use. It refers less to things like service design, which American companies still haven’t universally integrated as a practice.  
  
Most of my career, I’ve have a bit of a double consciousness where I have “tech friends” and then lots of people in my family or friend groups who not only have no idea what I’m talking about, but are the ones _using_ the (often) shitty interfaces or confusing tools that we spend our time negotiating.  
  
I’m constantly thinking about _how_ we could do a better job making things that get released into the wild, and wondering what sort of awful concessions got made. Here’s the problem: So much of design is really about business decisions, because designers so rarely have a seat at the big table. When they do, it’s a bunch of marketers, beancounters, and sometimes engineers discounting the importance of things, because it doesn’t increase ROI or seems like it’ll take longer or cost more.  
  
If every industry operated the way tech does, they’d likely be shutdown because people would routinely die based on really awful decisions made because nobody asked themselves things like _“what will happen when someone takes this phone interface we made and drive in their car going 60mph hurtling down a road with it and trying to text their buddy?”  
_  
Sure, people should be responsible. But there are ways we could have baked friction into the process earlier to fix these issues. But it’s not only about cars. What about the text that’s too small to read on subway ticket displays? Why are payment mobile interfaces still so clunky (at best?) I’m sure people think of these things, there are lots of articles online that indicate _somebody_ asked the questions at some point in the process, but clearly they didn’t win and when these things get neglected over and over again, it leaves us in a situation where people suffer. Lives are negatively impacted. And it’s total bullshit.

  
So where does that leave us? I think in 2019, the fact that we don’t have companies with people whose job it is to think about these things and to bake these thoughts into the process so that we can mitigate the challenges is problematic.

  
Sure, more and more places are trying to talk about “ethical design” or worse, want to hire ethicists to come in and help solve for some of these problems. It’s not a bad idea in the abstract, but there’s something lossy about asking non-technical people (or non-designers) to help us wrestle with things that the process should reflect at every stage.

  
It goes beyond just the design process, the customer journey or service experience map is full of gaps that get ignored or neglected. Sure, there are nice people who follow up. Sometimes, we do surveys. Other times, we follow up because there’s more money to potentially be made by doing so. But so many experiences simply never get heard, so many data points get ignored because it’s easier to amalgamate them into an assumptive subset of ideas that make us feel more comfortable. Not surprisingly, this really depends on our worldview or perspective.

So many articles about these topics are loathe to dole out answers. I think that’s a totally abdication of the responsibility our audiences instill in us. The answers are not easy, nor one-size-fits-all. Until we start making actionable steps towards fixing them, we’re going to spend years circling the wagons while things continue to get worse.
