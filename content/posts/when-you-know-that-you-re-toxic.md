Platforms are businesses, but I've become increasingly weary at the complicity of operating in a social media landscape where we're just supposed to act like we're watching the movie, rather than being part of it.

Being on Twitter often feels like an out-of-body experience, because you get to interact (often) with like-minded people who make you feel like ridiculous about those things that your family didn't care about at the dinner table. The problem is, this myopia extends to the ways we design platforms and tools amidst large-scale change. I realize there have always been issues in different parts of the world, and what's fueling my lens is the discord and chaos to hit the United States along with a pandemic. But many of the ideas I've been sharing were ruminating well before all this.

I'm just not sure how we're supposed to operate like nothing has changed. UIs and microcopy remain the same, Instagram [designed their latest extractive change to trick users into using lesser-used parts of the application](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/instagram-swaps-out-its-activity-tab-for-shop-in-new-global-test/), because I recognize their audience isn't just users but also businesses. At what point though, do you draw a line? We all watched as the US Capitol was overrun the other day, platforms hosted both sides of this "skirmish" and we're supposed to act like this is okay.

We used to live in a regular world where we'd go to restaurants and you'd get asked whether you want to sit in the smoking section or not. Turns out, not sitting in the smoking section still exposed you -- and the people working there -- to increased risk of lung cancer. Eventually, we stopped doing that and now we don't recall it. Being part of Twitter amidst a pandemic, doesn't feel like contributing to the solution on balance. 

More importantly, having the power to operate platforms in this chaotic world should force all of us working at the intersection of product design to answer hard questions about _"what is the responsibility of design at a time like this?"_ I've been going off about consequence design for the past year, but this is what I'm getting at. For all of the talk about stuff we're doing "behind the scenes," I'm asking aloud how we all as designers do a better job of showing the work -- not just performative, but actionable -- about the processes and ways to impact changes (both large and small) on the ways platforms, tools, and systems work.

Just saying "we're doing the work" isn't enough. Folks feel real comfortable sharing their wins and trade secrets when it's beneficial to the bottom line, but we really need to be digging into the weeds more proactively about how to design for crisis.

Tools that don't acknowledge current realities gaslight users into thinking their problems are imagined, that their stressors aren't real, and cause real harm. Microcopy helps, but continuing to operate platforms in an alternate reality than the ones they were conceived (because they're extractive and beneficial to their producers) seems dystopian. Participating in it provides a salve and a connection point, and I'm just as complicit as a participant.   
The difference is, my rants don't impact whether these tools improve or not. What's worse? We use models from industry leaders as so-called best practice, which makes it hard to improve public services because people assume that the very flawed internet they use everyday is the "good" way to do things. 

We need more imagination for these times. Designers aren't alone, this is a team effort. I'm just increasingly becoming exhausted by the idea that we're supposed to turn an eye to the very real flaws of large-scale platforms, and admonish designers with power to leverage their megaphones to excavate the real harm so we can reimagine better futures.
