From websites to building end-to-end digital products, I've been involved in all sorts of For nearly three years, I've worked on some of the world's biggest problems as part of [**18F**](https://18f.gsa.gov/), an innovation product office within the federal government.

Right now, I'm the girls varsity head coach for a private high school in Portland.
